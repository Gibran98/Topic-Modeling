Fue introducida por David Blei, Andrew Ng y Michael Jordan en 2002 y es presentado como un modelo en grafo para topic modelling. La idea principal es que un documento es una mezcla de varias categorias y estas tienen una distribución de Dirichlet. La clave de este algoritmo es:\n",

        "# Conclusiones\n",
        "Topic modeling es una aplicación sumamente poderosa del procesamiento de lenguaje natural, y puede ayudar en bastantes escenarios diferentes. Por ejemplo, en un buscador para darle ciertos resultados al usuario de su consulta, o incluso para mantener un orden de ciertos documentos. Aún así, no es una aplicación nueva como se puede ver con LDA, que se propuso originalmente en el 2003. Sin embargo, hasta el día de hoy se siguen empujando sus límites con modelos como BERTopic y Amazon Comprehend.\n",
        "\n",
        "Una de las razones por las que decidimos incluir el modelo de Amazon fue que queríamos comparar los resultados que sacaba con los de BERTopic, y de lo que se puede ver aquí sí son algo parecidos, aunque claramente los de BERTopic son más completos y se pueden visualizar de más formas con las gráficas que ofrece. No obstante, pensamos que ambos modelos fueron bastante buenos a lo que diría la intuición. El ejemplo que usamos fue recopilar tweets de IGN, que generalmente habla sobre videojuegos, películas y series. Y como se puede ver en las gráficas arriba, los tópicos resultantes sí tienen que ver con estos conceptos generales."
